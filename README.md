# GameStash
---
GameStash is an application for user to be able to find new games to play, review and let others know their thoughts on games they've already played, or just engage with the community through the forums.

Getting Started
---
Clone the repository and install it locally. Restore all NuGet packages, this application has a major emphasis on Entity Framework. Make sure bootstrap v3.4.1 is installed. Once everything is installed run the application, it's not necessary off the bat as you'll be prompted to later but I suggest creating an account to experience everything with no interruptions.
